## Project Overview

This repository hosts the foundational software and control systems for a real-time interactive wheeled robot, developed entirely within the Unity engine. Designed by a Robotics Software Engineer in 2025, this project serves as a robust core platform for exploring advanced robotic behaviors and sophisticated control algorithms intended for genuine, physical robot hardware.

## Features

* **Dynamic Locomotion:** Implements core software for controlling wheeled robot movement.
* **Precise User-Driven Navigation:** Enables intuitive and accurate control of the robot.
* **Robust Physics Integration:** Leverages Unity's physics engine for realistic environmental interactions, simulating real-world physical constraints and dynamics.
* **Modular Software Architecture:** Built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of new features, sensors, and control algorithms.
* **Real-time Interaction:** Designed for immediate feedback and responsive control.

## Technical Details

This project is developed using **Unity**, primarily leveraging **C#** for scripting. It focuses on the software layer that would interface with a physical robot's hardware. While the current state is a simulation environment, the underlying control logic and architectural patterns are designed with a direct application to real-world robotics in mind.

## Getting Started

To explore or contribute to this project, you will need Unity installed.

### Prerequisites

* [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
* [Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (Version used for development will be indicated in `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` once Unity project is pushed.)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PokePiece/My-project.git](https://github.com/PokePiece/My-project.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Unity:**
    * Open Unity Hub.
    * Click "Add Project" and navigate to the cloned `My-project` folder.
    * Select the `My-project` folder and click "Add Project."
    * Open the project in the Unity Editor.

### Running the Simulation

Once the project is open in the Unity Editor:

1.  Navigate to the primary scene (e.g., `Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity` or similar).
2.  Press the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to run the simulation.
3.  Utilize the in-app controls (if implemented) or follow any on-screen instructions for interacting with the robot.
