# Asset meta files that are generated and can sometimes cause conflicts (less common to ignore this)
# You might want to include these if you're working with a team, but if you're solo and only want scripts,
# you could consider ignoring them, though it can lead to asset re-imports.
# Keep them if you want proper asset linking in Unity.
# *.meta

# Packages folder
# ---------------
# The Packages folder is usually managed by Unity's Package Manager.
# It often contains cached packages in Library/PackageCache.
# The actual manifest and lock files are in ProjectSettings/Packages/
# If you want to ONLY include scripts and very small assets, you might ignore this,
# but usually you want to include Manifest.json and Packages-lock.json.
# If you ignore the whole folder, Unity will redownload everything, which is usually fine.
# If you want to include package manifests for version control, you'd exclude:
# Packages/*
#!Packages/manifest.json
#!Packages/packages-lock.json
